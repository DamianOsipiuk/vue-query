Vue Query is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make sure the library and your projects are type-safe!

Things to keep in mind:

- Currently, the required TypeScript version is v4.1 or greater.
- Changes to types in this repository are considered **non-breaking** and are usually released as **patch** semver changes (otherwise every type enhancement would be a major version!).
- It is **highly recommended that you lock your vue-query package version to a specific patch release and upgrade with the expectation that types may be fixed or upgraded between any release**
- The non-type-related public API of Vue Query still follows semver very strictly.
